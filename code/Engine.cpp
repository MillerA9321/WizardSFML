//I'm sorry that I wasn't able to work on the project this weekend, but I have all day on Monday and Tuesday to work on it
//Also did the professor make any comments about our UML Diagram? Unfortunately I screwed up on turning it in and the only comment I got was that it would not open.
//I'll finish up the Entity class tomorrow and try to make atleast our textures behave and print out as they are supposed to on screen by Monday
//If we get stuck on anything I could always go to his Office Hours on Tuesday because it is right after my Chem Class
//Hopefully everything goes smoothly tomorrow and I don't run into a million errors

//The only comment on the UML he made was
//"One issue, in general you don't need to talk about code specifics (classes, etc)
//in your requirements, just stick to the functionality."
