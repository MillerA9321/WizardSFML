//I have not been able to figure out why the arena or the player is not centered yet
//For me I do not see the player in linux but I do see the player when I run it on windows studios
//It is stuck at the upperleft corner 
//On Tuesday, I will wrap up making the slime vectors and make the score board and health bar show up
//I'll try to make a Game Over title screen as well
//I'll make a mana potion sprite as well since it looks like you added a reloading feature
//I tried to make a custom background work but it end up all wonky so I will look into that today
//I found out why the sprite are all so tiny and fixed the Green slime and king slime textures so far so I will wrap those up tomorrow as well
//Hopefully I can get more done Tuesday than Monday because I've mainly just stared at zombies
//trying to figure out why things are centering and how I plan to implement the slimes
//Right now, instead of a leveling up feature I am going more on a more "till you die" type of game
//so each slime spawns at a different interval of time, like green slime: 5 seconds, red slime: 10 seconds
